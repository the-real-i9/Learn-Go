# Overview
**`for` loops** are <u>the only loops in Go</u>. They can be of **four forms**:
```go
// a regular for loop
for initilization; condition; postIncDec {
  // ...
}

// a traditional while loop
for condition {
  // ...
}

// an infinite loop
for {
  // ...
}

// iteration for loop: iterates over a range object
for value := range object { // single-value range
  // ...
}
for _, value2 := range object { // double-value range

}
```

The "initialization" portion of the `for` loop must be a simple statement that is a <u>short variable</u>, an <u>increment or assignment statement</u>, or a <u>function call</u>.


The *blank identifier* ("`_`") may be used whenever syntax requires a variable name but program logic does not, for instance to discard an unwanted loop index when we require only the element value.

---

A *short variable declaration* may be <u>used only within a function</u>, not for package-level variables.

---

`map[type]type` explained
- `[type]` specifies the data type of the key
- `type` specifies the data type of the value

The order of iteration is not specified for a `map` range, it is random, varying from one run to another.
- The `map` type is not an ordered collection though, since it doesn't use an index.

---

A channel is a communication mechanism allows one goroutine to pass values of a specified type to another goroutines. The channel either has a <u>bounded capacity buffer</u> or a <u>zero capacity buffer</u>, in which case the channel is unbuffered
```go
// create channel (of "string" type)
ch := make(chan string) // zero capacity buffer or unbuffered channel
ch := make(chan int, 5) // bounded capacity buffer

// pass channel to functiion
func f(ch chan<- string)
f(ch)

// send data (of "type") to channel
ch <- "string" // or an expression that computes to "type"

// receive data from channel
<-ch // e.g. fmt.Print(<-ch)
```

---

The "main" function runs in a goroutine and the `go` statement creates additional goroutines that runs asynchronously (multiple `go func(...args)` runs concurrently)
- When one goroutine attempts a send or receive on a channel, it blocks until another goroutine attempts the corresponding receive or send operation, at which point the value is transferred and both goroutines proceed.

---

`fmt.Sprint(string)` variations works like `fmt.Print(string)` variations, but rather than print to os.Stdout, it formats accordingly and returns the resulting string.

`fmt.Fprint(w, string)` variations, formats accordingly writes the resulting string to `w io.Writer`

`log` works like `fmt`, but executes some system call after.

----

To make a folder into a module/package. In the folder, run this command
```bash
go mod init ${parentFolder}/${folder}
```
This creates a `go.mod` file in your folder. With the contents:
```mod
module ${parentFolder}/${folder}

go ${versionNumber}
```

- <u>**Before** your folder becomes a module,</u> all `.go` files in it are independent, in that case, multiple `.go` files can contain `func main()` and can bear any package name (including "main")
- <u>**After** your folder becomes a module,</u> all go files in it are related, in that case, only one `.go` file can contain `func main()` and all `.go` files must have the same `package ${name}`, where `${name}` can be your `customPackageName` or `main`.

There are **two kinds of module/package**: one that's a custom package and the other a special "main" package. What you get depends on the package name you declare in your `.go` file(s).\
Regardless of your module name (folder name)
- if you delare `package main`, your module becomes the main package/module, it becomes the entry point of execution, all other packages are imported into it directly or indirectly. But, 
- if you declare `package customPackageName`, it becomes a custom package, that may imported by the main package/module directly or indirectly

You can **compile** <u>only a `package main`</u> module/package/folder into one executable. 
- Custom packages that it dependes on will be compiled internally and dynamically imported.

---

Go allows a simple statement such as a local variable declaration to precede the `if` condition, which is particularly useful for error handling, or basically if condition depends on the statement.
```go
// basic if
if condition {}

// with simple statement
if statement; condition {}
// same as puting `statement` before the line
```

---

**Control flow:** `switch`
```go
switch expression {
case condition:
  evaluation
...
default:
  evaluation
}
```
Other than `if` and `for`, we have the `switch`.

`expression` is optional, if not included, it's called a *tagless* switch, which defaults to `true`.

`case`s <u>do not fallthrough from one to the next</u> as in C-like languages (where you have to use a `break` statement to go out of the control flow). *(though there is a rarely used `fallthrough` statement that overides this behaviour)*.

The `break` and `continue` statements modify the flow of control, as expected.

---

Before you embark on any new program, it's a good idea to see if packages already exist that might help you get your job done more easily.

---

The Go Language tool in your code editor (VSCode), recognizes **exported declarations**. That is, <u>declarations with first-letter-uppercase names</u>.
- When you hover over a declaration, you'll see the format `{package}.{DeclarationName}` in blue highlight.
- For example, an exported constant declaration in the main package, `const PI int = 3.14`, will have `main.PI`.
- Another example, an exported variable declaration in an exported struct, in the main package, will have `(main.Employee).Firstname`
  ```go
  type Employee struct {
    Firstname, surname
  }
  ```

## The flag package

`package flag` implements command-line flag parsing.

It uses a program's command-line arguments to set the vaues of certain variables distributed throughout the program.

It allows us define new "flag command-line arguments" and make use of them.

```go
var sep = flag.String("s", " ", "error message")

flag.Parse()

fmt.Print(strings.join(flag.Args(), *sep))
```
> First we define our command-line flags
```go
var sep = flag.String("s", " ", "error message")
/* (flagName, flagDefaultValue, flagErrorMessage) */
```
`sep` allows us to use the flag `-s` of the cmd-line in our program as a string.


> Next, we parse the command-line arguments to identify the flag and non-flag ones.
```go
flag.Parse()
```
The flag argruments are the ones we've defined and the non-flag args are the ones we didn't define 


> Finally, we then use the flag:
```go
fmt.Print(strings.join(flag.Args(), *sep))
```

`flag.Args()` is the range[] of all "non-flag" args
- `sep` identifies the flag in our program, while `-s` identifies the flag in the command-line
  - the value of the flag is what (string) immediately follows `-s`, we use `*sep` to get it in our program, as `sep` holds the address of the variable containg the value.
  - if the flag isn't specified, its default value is used with the above line of code

When our control encounters this line of code, it replaces `*sep` with the value specified in the cmd-line as the separator
  - if we specify `-s \`, then "`\`" is the separator
  - if the flag is not specified the default value of the flag is used.

Both `sep` and `-s` are same, the former helps use it in our program, while the latter helps use it in the command-line

If an undefined flag is used, the error message specified with our flags will throw.

> ðŸ˜Žâœ¨This is a major tool in building command-line applications. For example,\
> To display help message for your program, you can create a boolean flag that checks if `-h` or `-help` is specified in the command-line arguments, follow by `fmt.Println("Help message")`.

# Program Structure

## Pointers

A *pointer* value is the *address* of a variable. A pointer is thus the location at which a value is stored.

With a pointer, <u>we can read or update the value of a variable indirectly</u>.

Each component of a variable of aggregage type (struct field or array element) is also a variable and thus has an address too.

Expressions that denote variables are the only expressions t which the *address-of* operator `&` may be applied.

> Since a pointer to a variable, is itself a variable, that holds the address of another variable. That means <u>a pointer itself a variable and is addressable</u>.
```go
var x = 10

var px = &x // pointer to x

var ppx = &px // pointer to the pointer variable of x

&px // address of pointer to x

*&px == &x // true
*ppx == &x // true
```

The zero value for a pointer is `nil`

Pointers are comparable; <u>two pointers are equal if and only if they point to the same variable or both are `nil`</u>

It is perfectly safe for a function to return the address of a local variable. The local variable will remain in existence even after the function has returned, and a pointer can refer to it.
- Comparing the function call with `==` will not equal each other.

Because a pointer contains the address of a variable, passing a pointer argument to a function makes it possible for the function to update the variable that was indirectly passed. *You're passing the actual memory box*.

Pointers are key to the `flag` package, check [The flag package](#the-flag-package) above.

---

## The `new` Function
Use the `new(T)` to create a *pointer to an unnamed variable* of type `T`. This is just a syntactic convenience, such that, you don't have to first declare a dummy unnamed variable before you can then create a pointer to it.
```go
// instead of
var dummy int;
var p = &dummy
*p = 2

// you can do
var p = new(int)
*p = 2
```

## Lifetime of Variables
The lifetime of a package-level variable is the entire execution of the program.
- You can access a package-level variable before it is declared.

The lifetime of a local variable starts each time its function is invoked, and ends when it becomes *unreachable* (in normal cases, when the function returns).
- A local variable is not available for access until it is declared.

A compiler may choose to allocate variables on the heap or on the stack.
  - If you assign a local variable to a package-level pointer variable, the local variable will be allocated on the heap rather than on the stack. This means you *escaped the local variable*, and it's still reachable.
  - This is good to keep in mind during performance optimization, since each variable that escapes requires an extra memory allocation.

Keeping unnecessary pointers to short-lived objects within long-lived objects, especially global variables, will prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the short-lived objects.

## Assignments
Expressions with multiple results must have multiple vaiables declared on the LHS, as many as the results.
- We can assign unwanted values to the blank identifier ( `-` ).

```go
f, err = os.Open("foo.txt")

_, err = io.Copy(os.Stdout, req.Body) // discard byte count
```

## Assignability
An assignment, explicit or implicit, is always legal if <u>the LHS (the variable) and the RHS (the value) have the same type</u>.

Whether two values may be compared with `==` and `!=` is related to assignability: <u>in any comparison, the first operand must be assignable to the type of the second operand, or vice versa</u>.

## Type Declarations
There are variables that share the same representation but signify very different concepts.

A `type` declaration defines a new *named type* that has the same *underlying type* as an existing type.
```go
type Celcius float64
type Farenheit float64
```

They  don't change the value or representaion in any way, but they make the change of meaning explicit.

A named type may provide notational convinience if it helps avoid writing out complex types over and over again. e.g. *struct*s.

```go

```

Named types also make it possible to define new behaviours for values of the type. These behaviors are expressed as a set of functions associated with the type, called the type's *methods*.
```go
func (c Celcius) toString() string {
  return fmt.Stprintf("%g", c)
}
```

# Basic Data Types
## Booleans
A value of type `bool`, has only two possible values, `true` and `false`.

Boolean values can be combined with the `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators, which have *short-circuit* behaviour.

---
## Runes (Unicode UTF-8)
A *rune* refers to any single *Unicode code point* or *Unicode character literal* 
- a number, a letter, an emoji, or any single character representation.
- a unicode escape representing a single character

UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for text strings manipulated by Go programs. 

For runes, a unicode escape represents one character literal. So as, an emoji represents just one character literal.
```go
"\u4e16"

"\U0001f60e"
```
There are two forms of unicode escapes in Go, `\uhhhh` for a 16-bit value and `\Uhhhhhhhh` for a 32-bit value. The latter is for values that exceeds 16-bit.

A rune whose value is less than 256 may be written with a single hexadecimal escape, such as `'\x41'` for `'A'`, but for higher values, a `\u` or `\U` escape must be used.
  > ASCII characters be represented in unicode escapes too `'\u0041'` for `'A'`, since they are those that actually begin the unicode character set.

**Legal rune literals** are those that <u>can be represented with a single hexadecimal or unicode escape</u>.

Go's `range` loop, when applied to a string, performs UTF-8 decoding implicitly.

It is mostly a matter of convention in Go that **text strings are interpreted as UTF-8-encoded sequences of Unicode code points**.

UTF-8 is exceptionally convenient as an interchange format but within a program runes may be more convinient because they are of uniform size and are thus easily indexed in arrays and slices.
- A `[]rune` conversion/casting applied to a UTF-8 encoded string <u>returns the sequence of Unicode code points that the string encodes</u>
  ```go
  s := "âœ¨ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ¯ðŸŽˆ"
  r := []rune(s) // ['âœ¨', 'ðŸ˜Ž', 'ðŸŽ¯', 'ðŸŽˆ']
  fmt.Printf("%c", r)
  ```
- If a slice of runes is converted to string, it produces the concatenation of the UTF-8 encodings of each rune:
  ```go
  fmt.Println(string(r))
  ```
- Converting an interger value to a string interprets the integer as a rune value, and yields the UTF-8 representation of that rune
  ```go
  fmt.Println(string(65))        // "A"
  fmt.Println(string(rune(65)))  // "A"
  ```

---

Four standard packages are particularly important for manipulating strings: `bytes`, `strings`, `strconv`, `unicode`.

## Contants
Constants are expressions whose value is known to the compiler and whose **evaluation is guaranteed to occur at compile time**. The underlying type of every constant is a basic type: boolean, string, or number.

A `const` declaration cannot be updated in the program.

As with variables, a sequence of constants can appear in one declaration;
```go
const (
  e = 2.718
  pi = 3.142
)
```

Many computations on constants can be completely evaluated at compile time. Evaluation errors detected at compile time thus be reported.

The results of all arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations applied to constants operands are themselves constants, as are the results of conversions and calls to certain buil-in functions such as `len`, `cap`, `real`, `imag`, `complex`, and `unsafe.Sizeof`.

Constant expressions can be used as the boudary of the array type, since their values are known to the compiler.
```go
const b int = 5
// var b int 5 /* var won't work */

var arr = [b]int{1,2,3,4}
```
When a constant expression of a particular type is used in our untyped `const` declaration, our `const` declaration implictly infers this constant expression's type.

When a sequence of constants is declared as a group, the right-hand side expession may be omitted for all but the first of the group, implying that the previous expression and its type should be used again.
```go
type Bro int
const (
  a Bro = 1
  b       // b Bro = 1
  c       // c Bro = 1
  d = 2
  e       // e = 2
)
```

### The constant generator
A `const` declaration may use the *constant generator* `iota`, which is used to create a sequence of related values without spelling out each one explicitly. In a const declaration, the value of `iota` begins at zero and increments by one for each item in the sequence.

```go
const (
  Sunday = iota // iota is "0"
  Monday        // "1" automatically generated
  Tuesday        // "2" automatically generated
)
```
This is a very useful feature, where you want to create different form of sequences with math, where you just have to specify the expression in the first constant with `iota`.

----

# Untyped constant
Only constants are can be untyped. When an untyped constant is assigned to a variable, or appears on the RHS of a variable declaration with an explicit type, the constant is implicitly converted to the type of that variable if possible.

Coverting a constant from one type to another requires that the target type can represent the original value.

In a variable declaration without an explicit type, the flavor of the untyped constant implicitly determines the default type of the variable.
- To give the variable a different type, we must explicitly convert the untyped constant to the desired type or state the desired type in the variable declaration.
